## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Package
```bash
cd /Users/shivamsingh/finalduckie
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

### 2. Run Lane Following
```bash
# Basic launch
roslaunch blueduckie_lane_following advanced_lane_following.launch

# With custom robot name
roslaunch blueduckie_lane_following advanced_lane_following.launch robot_name:=blueduckie
```

### 3. Monitor Performance
```bash
# Check node status
rostopic echo /blueduckie/wheels_driver_node/wheels_cmd

# Monitor camera feed
rostopic echo /blueduckie/camera_node/image/compressed
```

## Algorithm Details

### Lane Detection Pipeline
1. **Image Preprocessing**: Convert to HSV, apply CLAHE, Gaussian blur
2. **Color Segmentation**: Separate yellow and white lane markers
3. **ROI Application**: Focus on relevant road area
4. **Morphological Operations**: Clean up noise and gaps
5. **Sliding Window Search**: Robust line detection across image height
6. **Kalman Filtering**: Smooth tracking with velocity prediction

### Control System
- **Adaptive PID**: Gains adjust based on detection confidence
- **Differential Steering**: Independent wheel speed control
- **Speed Modulation**: Slower on curves, faster on straights
- **Safety Limits**: Maximum speeds and steering angles

## Parameter Tuning

Key parameters in `config/blueduckie_params.yaml`:

### Speed Control
- `base_speed`: Normal driving speed (0.3 m/s)
- `max_speed`: Maximum allowed speed (0.5 m/s)
- `min_speed`: Minimum speed for stability (0.15 m/s)

### PID Tuning
- `kp_base`: Proportional gain (0.8)
- `ki_base`: Integral gain (0.02)
- `kd_base`: Derivative gain (0.15)

### Vision Tuning
- `roi_top_ratio`: Start of region of interest (0.4)
- `roi_bottom_ratio`: End of region of interest (0.9)
- Color thresholds for yellow/white detection

## Deployment

### For Duckietown Container (dt-duckietown-interface)
1. Copy package to container workspace
2. Build with `catkin_make`
3. Source the workspace
4. Launch with proper robot name parameter

### Development Testing
- Test on Mac M2 with ROS simulation
- Use rosbag files for consistent testing
- Monitor performance metrics

## Success Criteria - Phase 1
- âœ… Smooth lane following on straight roads
- âœ… Stable curve navigation with predictive steering
- âœ… Robust performance in varying lighting conditions
- âœ… Real-time processing at 30+ FPS
- âœ… Integration with Duckietown infrastructure

## Next Phases
- Phase 2: Intersection handling and traffic sign recognition
- Phase 3: Multi-robot coordination and fleet management
- Phase 4: Advanced AI integration and learning capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No camera feed**: Check camera node is running
2. **Erratic steering**: Tune PID parameters in config file
3. **Slow performance**: Reduce image processing resolution
4. **Poor line detection**: Adjust color thresholds for lighting conditions

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in launch file:
```xml
<param name="~debug/enable_logging" value="true"/>
```

## Dependencies
- ROS Noetic (recommended)
- OpenCV 4.x
- NumPy
- duckietown_msgs
- cv_bridge
- image_transport
